		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am a passionate front-end developer with hands-on experience in creating visually engaging and user-centric websites. With a solid foundation from an ALX certificate in front-end development, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am proficient in tools like Figma for design and prototyping. I am adept at using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, ensuring high-quality code and seamless integration. Outside of coding, I enjoy experimenting with web design trends, reading a variety of genres for inspiration, and capturing moments through photography, all of which contribute to my creative approach in web development.</p>
